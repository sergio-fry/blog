# Sergei Udalov

**Senior Software Engineer & Technical Team Lead | Ruby/Rails Expert | Building Scalable Solutions**

Contact: sergei.udalov@gmail.com, https://t.me/SergeiUdalov


Experienced software engineer and technical leader with 17+ years in software development, specializing in Ruby on Rails and team leadership since 2017. Currently managing multiple product teams (18+ developers) and delivering high-impact solutions in e-commerce and fintech domains.

I have successfully led development of innovative platforms including ultra-fast delivery systems (Samokat), large-scale marketplaces (Megamarket), and comprehensive financial services ecosystems. My expertise spans microservices architecture, AI/RAG implementations, and scalable distributed systems using Ruby, Go, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL.

As a technical leader, I focus on building high-performing teams through mentoring, implementing Domain-Driven Design principles, and establishing robust development processes. I have mentored 5+ developers to promotions and prepared successors for leadership roles. My teams consistently deliver complex solutions while maintaining code quality and system reliability.

Beyond technical leadership, I am actively involved in the developer community as a speaker at RubyRussia conferences (2023/2024/2025), host of the HeavyTech podcast, and content creator on YouTube and Telegram. I also served as a course instructor at GeekBrains, sharing knowledge about modern development practices and technology trends.

My passion extends beyond coding to philosophy, sports (football, table tennis, badminton, volleyball, snowboarding), and music. I believe in continuous learning and enjoy discussing technology trends, architectural decisions, and team development strategies with fellow professionals.
